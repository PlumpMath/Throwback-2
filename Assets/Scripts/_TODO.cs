// GENERAL TODO
// Add attribution for graphics (at least list games) and music/sound fx

// SoundFX: https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style
// Music: ericskiff.com/music/


// EMO TODO
// enemy sprites that shoot projectiles
// crumbling sprite that reappears
// start thinking about an opening animation
// Fix nozapper jump frames
// Spike damage not working
// Unable to collect Tetris piece
// Add iFrames to hit sprite



// BRAD TODO
// Melee bug: if you get hit during the first frame of melee, you take damage and still destory the enemy even if the melee FX never show up
// Swivel contraUpper in prefab based on angle of shot



// - Also shyguy turns around on collision with Wall, where Platform turns around at center point. Can you set platform up to do this? It would help level layout I could use the edge of the start/end boxes for alignement.



// PAULISH
// Dim screen with collectibles
// - Don't clear until the relevant button is pressed
// - Can use MessageBG.png sprite behind text to darken everything else


// DONE =================
// There is a difference with the enemies and their Wall collisions. The shyguy works, the goomba does not.
// - It looks like OnCollisionEnter vs OnTriggerEnter. I didn't want to mess with it.
// - On that note, can we get goomba to turnaround on actual walls, and not the ones I add via Tiled? I can make multiple object layers if you need both.
